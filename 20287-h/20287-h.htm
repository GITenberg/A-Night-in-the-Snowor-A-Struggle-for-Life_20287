3</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>In publishing the following account of &ldquo;A Night in the 
Snow,&rdquo; which has already been given as a Lecture before the
Society for the Promotion of Religious and Useful Knowledge at 
Bridgnorth, I feel that some apology is due.</p>
<p>My preservation through the night of the 29th of January last 
was doubtless most wonderful, and my experience perhaps almost 
without precedent, in this country at least; for, though many 
people have at different times been lost in the snow, scarcely 
any one has <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>passed through the ordeal of such a 
day and night as that undergone by myself, and lived to tell the 
tale.&nbsp; Still I should never have thought that the matter was
of sufficient importance to justify me in printing an account of 
it, had I not discovered that my adventure has created a public 
interest, for which I was totally unprepared.&nbsp; I have been 
so repeatedly asked to write a detailed account of all the 
circumstances connected with my wanderings on the Long Mynd in 
the snow during that night and the following day, and to have it 
published, that I have at last (though, I must confess, somewhat 
reluctantly) consented to do so, and with that view have drawn up
the following account.</p>
<p>In writing my story, I have been obliged to go into many very 
small matters of detail, which may perhaps appear trivial; but it
seemed to me <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>that the interest of a story of this 
kind, if there be any interest attached to it, generally turns 
upon minor circumstances.&nbsp; I have also been obliged to speak
of myself in a very personal manner, but I did not see how I 
could put the reader in possession of the geographical points of 
the case, without describing the duties I had to perform, and the
country I had to traverse.</p>

7</span>A NIGHT IN THE SNOW.</h2>
<p>The mountains of South-West Shropshire are less known to the 
lovers of fine scenery than their great beauty deserves, though 
they are familiar to most geologists as the typical region of the
lowest fossil-bearing deposits.&nbsp; Of this group of hills the 
highest is the Long Mynd, a mountain district of very remarkable 
character, and many miles in extent.&nbsp; It is about ten miles 
long, and from three to four miles in breadth.&nbsp; Its summit 
is a wide expanse of table land, the highest part of which is 
nearly seventeen hundred <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>feet above the level of the sea.&nbsp;
The whole of this unenclosed moorland is covered with gorse and 
heather, making it extremely gay in the summer time; it is also 
tolerably abundant in grouse and black game, and so fruitful in 
bilberries, that from &pound;400 to &pound;500 worth are said to 
have been gathered on it in the course of a single season.&nbsp; 
On first hearing it, this sounds an improbable statement; but any
one who has been upon the mountain in a good &ldquo;whinberry 
season&rdquo; as it is called, will readily understand that this 
is no exaggeration.&nbsp; To the poor people for miles around, 
the &ldquo;whinberry picking&rdquo; is the great event of the 
year.&nbsp; The whole family betake themselves to the hill with 
the early morning, carrying with them their provisions for the 
day; and not unfrequently a kettle to prepare tea forms part of 
their load.&nbsp; I know no more picturesque sight than that 
presented <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>by the summit of the Long Mynd towards
four o&rsquo;clock on an August afternoon, when numerous fires 
are lit among the heather, and as many kettles steaming away on 
the top of them, while noisy, chattering groups of women and 
children are clustered round, glad to rest after a hard 
day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; A family will pick many quarts of 
bilberries in the day, and as these are sold at prices varying 
from 3d. to 5d. a quart, it will be readily understood that it is
by no means impossible that the large sum of &pound;400 or 
&pound;500 should thus be realised in a single season.</p>
<p>The appearance of this Long Mynd mountain on the northern 
side, looking towards Shrewsbury, presents no feature of striking
interest, and the ascent is a gradual one, leading chiefly 
through cultivated ground; but the aspect of the south-eastern or
Stretton side is <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>wild in the extreme, the whole face 
of the mountain being broken up into deep ravines, with 
precipitous sides, where purple rocks project boldly through the 
turf, and in many places even the active sheep and mountain 
ponies can scarcely find a footing.&nbsp; Down each of these 
ravines runs a small stream of exquisitely pure water, one of 
which, near the entrance of the valley, becomes considerable 
enough to turn a mill for carding wool.&nbsp; This stream falls 
over rocks at the head of the ravine, in a small cascade of a 
considerable height called the Light Spout.</p>
<p>Many people have lost their lives among these hills at 
different times, and places here and there bear such suggestive 
names, as &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Beach,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dead 
Man&rsquo;s Hollow,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; The last fair, too, 
which is held at Church Stretton before Christmas is locally 
known as &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Fair,&rdquo; <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>several men 
have perished whilst attempting to return home after it across 
the hill in the dark November night.&nbsp; No one, however, till 
this winter has been lost for many years.&nbsp; Two drovers were 
the last persons who perished here, and they lost their lives 
near a place called &ldquo;The Thresholds,&rdquo; in a deep snow 
which fell in April thirty-seven years ago.</p>
<p>The western slope of the Long Mynd is less strikingly 
picturesque and more desolate, but the view from the top in this 
direction is the finest of any.&nbsp; Almost unseen in a narrow 
valley at the foot of the mountain, stand the village and church 
of Ratlinghope, the centre of a parish numbering about three 
hundred souls only, but which stretches over miles of mountain 
country, embracing a portion of the wild mining district of the 
Stiper Stones.&nbsp; Beyond these hills the eye passes to <!-- 
page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>the Welsh mountains, and rests at last on the grand 
peaks of Cader Idris in one direction, and Snowdon in the other, 
which may be seen in clear weather sharply defined against a 
sunset sky.</p>
<p>Poor Ratlinghope was in sore need of some one to look after it
when the living was offered to me in September 1856.&nbsp; It had
at that time been left for many Sundays together without a 
service, the late incumbent residing in Shrewsbury, twelve miles 
distant, and being frequently prevented by ill health from coming
over.&nbsp; There is no house in the parish where a clergyman 
could live, or even procure tolerable lodgings; and if there 
were, there is next to nothing, as one of the parishioners said 
to me the other day, &ldquo;to find coals to warm it 
with.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is scarcely to be wondered at that under 
these circumstances, when the living became vacant <!-- page 
13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>in 
the summer of 1856, there was no suitable person to be found who 
was willing to accept so desirable a piece of preferment.&nbsp; 
The parish of Wolstaston, of which I have the charge, and in 
which I reside, is situated on high ground on the eastern slope 
of the Long Mynd, <i>i.e.</i> exactly on the opposite side of the
mountain to Ratlinghope.&nbsp; Above Wolstaston the ground rises 
steadily for about a mile and a half till you come to the 
unenclosed moorland, which stretches away for many miles of open 
country, covered with heather and gorse.&nbsp; It was under the 
circumstances that I have already mentioned that the living of 
Ratlinghope was offered to me.&nbsp; I was aware that it would be
impossible to attend to the parish as one would wish to do, with 
four miles of this wild hill country to cross between the two 
villages.&nbsp; Still, as no one else could be found to take it, 
and I thought that <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the Ratlinghope people might think 
that &ldquo;half-a-loaf was better than no bread,&rdquo; I 
consented to accept the living, and do the best I could for it; 
so I altered my second service at Wolstaston from three 
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon to six, which enabled me to give 
an afternoon service at Ratlinghope every Sunday.</p>
<p>I soon found, however, that the task I had undertaken was no 
very light one, as the only access from Wolstaston to Ratlinghope
was by mountain tracks, over the highest part of the Long Mynd, 
unless indeed one drove round the base of the hill, a distance of
at least twelve miles.&nbsp; The ride was pleasant enough in fine
weather, but less enjoyable when fogs hung heavy over the hill, 
when the tracks were slippery with ice, or when falling snow 
concealed every landmark.&nbsp; It not unfrequently happened in 
winter, when <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the snow was very deep, or much 
drifted, that it was impossible to ride across the hill, and the 
expedition then had to be performed on foot; still I always 
managed to cross somehow, in spite of wind or weather, so that 
during the last eight years and a half the little mountain church
has never been without one Sunday service.&nbsp; I find that 
during that time I have crossed the Long Mynd (in round numbers) 
nearly two thousand five hundred times; consequently my knowledge
of the country became so intimate, that I felt equally at home 
upon the hill in all weathers, and at all hours of the day and 
night.&nbsp; On one occasion, I had to cross it late on a 
November night and in a dense fog, when returning home from 
Ratlinghope, and met with no accident; and I think that this and 
similar experiences made me somewhat over confident.&nbsp; I 
mention this to show how <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>little the 
most perfect acquaintance with country will avail any one when 
overtaken by such a blinding snow storm as that of the 29th of 
January last.</p>
<p>During the preceding week the snow fell heavily, and 
accumulated on the hills to a greater depth than had been known 
for fifty-one years.&nbsp; Public opinion was unanimous that 
there had been nothing like it since 1814.&nbsp; A strong wind, 
moreover, had so drifted it that the roads were impassable, and 
the communication between neighbouring villages, and even between
houses in the same village, almost ceased.&nbsp; Letters wont to 
be received in the morning arrived late in the day, or not at 
all; and unhappy folk who were unprovided with a good store of 
food and coals had either to borrow of their neighbours or 
starve.&nbsp; The morning service at Wolstaston on Sunday the 
29th was of necessity but thinly attended, <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>and it seemed
probable that I should not even be expected at Ratlinghope.&nbsp;
As, however, the service there had never been omitted owing to 
bad weather, I was anxious to get to my little church if 
possible; in fact, I considered it my duty to make the attempt, 
though I felt very doubtful whether I should succeed.</p>
<p>Accordingly, very soon after morning service at Wolstaston was
over, I started on the expedition.&nbsp; I was in such a hurry to
be off that I could not stay to take my usual luncheon, but 
swallowed a few mouthfuls of soup, and put a small flask 
containing about three ounces of brandy in my pocket.&nbsp; My 
taking anything of the kind with me was a most unprecedented 
circumstance.&nbsp; I only remember one other occasion in which I
did so, and that was also in a very deep snow; but now foreseeing
a walk of no common <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>difficulty, I thought the precaution 
a wise one, and saw reason afterwards to be thankful that I had 
adopted it.</p>
<p>I started on horseback, though I knew that I could only ride a
short distance, but thought it advisable to save myself all 
unnecessary fatigue.&nbsp; I was of course accompanied by a 
servant to bring back the horses when they were of no further 
use.&nbsp; By leaving the lane and making our way across the 
fields over hedge and ditch, we contrived to ride about half a 
mile.&nbsp; The horses then became useless, as the drifts were so
deep against the hedges and gates, that the poor animals became 
imbedded in them, and were unable to find any firm footing to 
leap from.&nbsp; The servant therefore had to return with them 
long before I reached the unenclosed mountain land, and I 
proceeded on my way alone.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>The journey proved more difficult even than I had 
expected.&nbsp; The snow was for the most part up to the knees 
and very soft, and the drifts were so deep that they could only 
be crossed by crawling on hands and knees, as any one will 
readily understand who has attempted to cross deep snow when in a
soft state.&nbsp; When I reached the open moorland the day was 
bright and fine, and the snow stretched around me for miles in a 
dazzling expanse very painful to the eyes, and unbroken by track,
landmark, or footprint of any living creature.&nbsp; The form of 
the country, however, was a sufficient guide to my destination, 
and after a severe struggle over and through the drifts, I 
reached my little church at a quarter-past three o&rsquo;clock, 
just two hours and a quarter from the time I had left 
Wolstaston.&nbsp; A few people were assembled together, though no
one had <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>really expected me, and after a short
service I started on my homeward journey, having refused the 
invitations of my kind people to stay the night amongst them, as 
I was anxious to get back to Wolstaston in time for my six 
o&rsquo;clock evening service, and I did not anticipate that I 
should encounter any greater difficulties in my return home than 
I had done in coming to Ratlinghope.</p>
<p>During the three quarters of an hour, however, that we had 
been in church, the aspect of the weather had completely 
changed.&nbsp; A furious gale had come on from E.S.E., which, as 
soon as I got on the open moorland, I found was driving clouds of
snow and icy sleet before it.&nbsp; It was with considerable 
difficulty that I made my way up the western ascent of the hill, 
as I had to walk in the teeth of this gale.&nbsp; The force of 
the wind was most extraordinary.&nbsp; <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>I have been 
in many furious gales, but never in anything to compare with 
that, as it took me off my legs, and blew me flat down upon the 
ground over and over again.&nbsp; The sleet too was most painful,
stinging one&rsquo;s face, and causing such injury to the eyes, 
that it was impossible to lift up one&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; I 
contrived, however, to fight my way through it, and at length 
reached the crest of the hill.&nbsp; Though I could not see many 
yards in any direction, I knew at this time exactly where I was, 
as I passed the carcase of a mountain pony which I had previously
noticed.&nbsp; The poor thing had no doubt been famished to 
death, and was fast wasting to a skeleton.&nbsp; Numbers of these
hardy little animals have perished during the severe weather from
hunger, having been previously reduced to the lowest condition 
through lack of pasturage during the <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>dry season of
1864.&nbsp; One man, who owned fourteen of them, has lost every 
one.</p>
<p>Leaving this solitary waymark, the half buried skeleton, by 
which I had rested for a few minutes and taken a little of my 
brandy, I started again, having first made a careful observation 
of the direction in which I should go.&nbsp; After a further 
struggle across the level summit of the hill, I reached my second
landmark, a pool in a little hollow between the hills, which is 
well known to the inhabitants of the district, and interesting to
naturalists, as the resort of curlews and other rare birds; here 
again I took a short rest, and then started upon what I fondly 
dreamed would be the last difficult stage of my journey.</p>
<p>My way from the pool lay first up a steep ascent for rather 
less than half a mile to the top of the hill, and then <!-- page 
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>across a level flat for some three or four hundred 
yards, when a fir plantation would be reached at the edge of the 
enclosed ground.&nbsp; Once within the friendly shelter of those 
firs, I knew that the remainder of my walk, though still tedious 
and fatiguing, would be comparatively easy.&nbsp; It pleased God,
however, that I should never reach them that night.&nbsp; 
Doubtless I had been too confident in my own powers, and at the 
very time when I thought the difficulties and dangers of my task 
were well nigh accomplished, I was taught a lesson which I shall 
remember to the latest hour of my life.&nbsp; I ascended the hill
to the flat already spoken of, though it was a very slow process,
for owing to the depth of the drifts, which were now increasing 
rapidly, and the force of the wind, I was compelled to crawl a 
great part of the way.&nbsp; The storm now came on, if possible, 
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>with increased fury.&nbsp; It was quite impossible to 
look up or see for a yard around, and the snow came down so thick
and fast that my servant, who had come some distance up the lane 
from Wolstaston in hopes of seeing something of me, describing it
to me afterwards, said, &ldquo;Sir, it was just as if they were 
throwing it on to us out of buckets.&rdquo;&nbsp; I fought on 
through it, however, expecting soon to come to the fir 
wood.&nbsp; On and on I went, but not a glimpse of its friendly 
shelter could I see, the real fact being that I had borne away a 
great deal too much to the right, almost at right angles to my 
proper course.&nbsp; Having been blown down over and over again, 
I had probably, in rising to my feet, altered my direction 
unconsciously.&nbsp; The wind too, by which I had been trying to 
steer, proved a treacherous compass; for, as I have been told, 
about this time it <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>went more round into the south.&nbsp;
It was, moreover, becoming very dark.&nbsp; After a while I 
became aware that the ground under my feet was of a wrong shape, 
sloping downwards when it should have been level, and I then knew
that I had missed my way.&nbsp; This, however, gave me no great 
uneasiness, as I imagined that I had only gone a little too much 
to the south of the wood, and that I should soon reach an 
inhabited district at the bottom of it, known as Bullock&rsquo;s 
Moor, from which a somewhat circuitous route would bring me 
safely home.&nbsp; Under this impression I walked cheerfully on, 
but only for a few steps further.&nbsp; Suddenly my feet flew 
from under me, and I found myself shooting at a fearful pace down
the side of one of the steep ravines which I had imagined lay far
away to my right.&nbsp; I thought to check myself by putting my 
stick behind me, <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>and bearing heavily upon it in the 
manner usual under such circumstances in Alpine travelling.&nbsp;
Before, however, I could do so I came in contact with something 
which jerked it out of my hand and turned me round, so that I 
continued my tremendous glissade head downwards, lying on my 
back.</p>
<p>The pace I was going in this headlong descent must have been 
very great, yet it seemed to me to occupy a marvellous space of 
time, long enough for the events of my whole previous life to 
pass in review before me, as I had often before heard that they 
did in moments of extreme peril.&nbsp; I never lost my 
consciousness, but had time to think much of those I should leave
behind me, expecting every moment as I did to be dashed over the 
rocks at the bottom of the ravine; knew in fact that such must 
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>be my fate, unless I could stop myself by some 
means.&nbsp; Owing to the softness of the snow, I contrived to 
accomplish this by kicking my foot as deep into the snow as I 
could, and at the same time bending my knee with a smart muscular
effort, so as to make a hook of my leg; this brought me to a 
stand still, but my position was anything but agreeable even 
then, hanging head downwards on a very steep part, and never 
knowing any moment but what I might start again.&nbsp; With much 
difficulty, however, I at length succeeded in getting myself the 
right way up, and then descended with great care to the bottom of
the ravine, intending if possible to walk along the course of the
stream in its hollow till it should lead me to the enclosed 
country.&nbsp; The ravine, however, was so choked up with snow, 
that to walk along the valley was utterly impossible.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>The drifts were many feet over my head, in several 
places they must have been at least twenty feet in depth; and 
having once got into them, I had the greatest difficulty, by 
scratching and struggling, to extricate myself from them 
again.&nbsp; It was now dark.&nbsp; I did not know into which of 
the ravines I had fallen, for at this part there is a complete 
network of them intersecting each other in every direction.&nbsp;
The only way by which I had thought to escape was hopelessly 
blocked up, and I had to face the awful fact that I was lost 
among the hills, should have to spend the night there, and that, 
humanly speaking, it was almost impossible that I could survive 
it.</p>
<p>The instinct of self-preservation, however, is strong, even 
when a fearful death seems close at hand, and there were others 
for whose sake, even more than my own, I desired <!-- page 
29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>that 
night that my life might be spared, if such were God&rsquo;s 
will.&nbsp; I knew that, under Providence, all depended on my own
powers of endurance, and that the struggle for life must be a 
very severe one.&nbsp; The depth of the snow made walking a very 
exhausting effort.&nbsp; It was always up to my knees, more often
up to my waist; but my only chance, as I was well aware, was to 
keep moving; and having extricated myself at last from the drifts
in the ravine, I began to climb the opposite side of the hill, 
though I had not the least idea in which direction I ought to 
go.&nbsp; As I made my way upwards, I saw just in front of me 
what looked like a small shadow flitting about, for owing to the 
white ground it was never completely dark.&nbsp; I was much 
surprised at this, especially as when I came close to it, it 
disappeared into the snow, with the <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>exception of 
one round dark spot, which remained motionless.&nbsp; I put my 
hand down upon this dark object to ascertain what it could 
possibly be, and found that I had got hold of a hare&rsquo;s 
head!&nbsp; I saw many of these little animals in the course of 
the night.&nbsp; They made holes in the snow for shelter, and sat
in them well protected by their warm coats, happier far than 
their human fellow-sufferer, who knew that for him there must be 
no rest that night if he would see the light of another day.</p>
<p>Having climbed the hill, I walked along its crest for some 
distance, till suddenly I again lost my footing, and shot down 
the hill, as far as I can judge, on the opposite side into 
another ravine.&nbsp; This was, if possible, a more fearful 
glissade than my previous one; it was a very precipitous place, 
and I was whirled round and round in my <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>descent, 
sometimes head first, sometimes feet first, and again sideways, 
rolling over and over, till at last, by clutching at the gorse 
bushes, and digging my feet into the snow as before, I once more 
managed to check my wild career, and bring myself to a stand; but
I had lost my hat and a pair of warm fur gloves, which I had on 
over a pair of old dogskins.&nbsp; The loss of these fur gloves 
proved very serious to me, as my hands soon began to get so 
numbed with the cold, that they were comparatively useless.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the ravine into which I had now fallen, I 
found myself again involved in snow drifts, and had still more 
difficulty than before in getting out of them.&nbsp; I had 
tumbled into a very soft one far over my head, and had to fight, 
and scratch, and burrow for a long time before I could extricate 
myself, and became more exhausted <!-- page 32--><a 
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>than at any 
other time during the night.&nbsp; I only ventured to take my 
brandy very sparingly, wishing to husband it as much as possible,
and there was but a very tiny drop left.&nbsp; My hands, as I 
have said, were so numbed with cold as to be nearly 
useless.&nbsp; I had the greatest difficulty in holding the 
flask, or in eating snow for refreshment, and could hardly get my
hands to my mouth for the masses of ice which had formed upon my 
whiskers, and which were gradually developed into a long crystal 
beard, hanging half way to my waist.&nbsp; Icicles likewise had 
formed about my eyes and eyebrows, which I frequently had to 
break off, and my hair had frozen into a solid block of 
ice.&nbsp; After the loss of my hat, my hair must, I suppose, 
have become filled with snow, while I was overhead in the 
drifts.&nbsp; Probably this was partially melted by the warmth of
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
33</span>my head, and subsequently converted into ice by the 
intense frost.&nbsp; Large balls of ice also formed upon my 
cuffs, and underneath my knees, which encumbered me very much in 
walking, and I had continually to break them off.&nbsp; I tried 
to supply the place of my hat by tying my handkerchief over my 
head, but found that by no possible effort could I make a knot, 
and that I could only keep it on my head by holding the corners 
between my teeth.&nbsp; It was equally impossible to refasten my 
overcoat, only a thin tweed (for I had dressed lightly, in 
expectation of hard exercise), which had become unbuttoned in my 
last fall.&nbsp; It may seem absurd to mention it, but the 
cravings of hunger grew so keen, stimulated as they were by the 
cold and the great exertion, that it actually occurred to me 
whether I could eat one of my old dogskin gloves.&nbsp; I was, 
however, deterred <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>from making the attempt, partly by 
the prospect of its toughness, and partly by the fear of greater 
injury to my hands from frost bite, if they were deprived of 
their last covering.&nbsp; My exhaustion was so great that I fell
down every two or three steps, and the temptation to give in and 
lie down in the snow became almost irresistible, and had to be 
struggled against with every power of mind and body.&nbsp; I 
endeavoured to keep constantly before me the certain fact, that 
if sleep once overcame me I should never wake again in this 
life.&nbsp; The night seemed interminably long.&nbsp; Again and 
again I tried to calculate the time, but always came to the same 
conclusion, that many hours must elapse before the return of 
daylight.&nbsp; The wind had gone down, and the stillness became 
so oppressive, that I often spoke aloud for the sake of hearing 
my own voice, and to ascertain that the cold, <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>which was 
intense, had not deprived me of the power of speech.&nbsp; The 
hares still sported and burrowed on the hill sides, but excepting
these there were no signs of life whatever.</p>
<p>Never did shipwrecked mariner watch for the morning more 
anxiously than did I through that weary, endless night, for I 
knew that a glimpse of the distance in any one direction would 
enable me to steer my course homewards.&nbsp; Day dawned at last,
but hope and patience were to be yet further tried, for a dense 
fog clung to the face of the hill, obscuring everything but the 
objects close at hand.&nbsp; Furthermore, I discovered that I was
rapidly becoming snow blind.&nbsp; My eyes, which had been 
considerably injured already by the sharp sleet of the evening 
before, were further affected by the glare of the snow, and I was
fast losing all distinctness of vision.&nbsp; I first learned the
extent of this new calamity <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>when 
endeavouring, with the earliest light, to look at my watch.&nbsp;
It was a work of great difficulty to get it out of my pocket; and
when this was done, I found that I could not tell the face from 
the back.&nbsp; The whole thing was hazy and indistinct, and I 
can only describe it as looking like an orange seen through a 
mist.&nbsp; Such sight as remained rapidly became all confusion 
as regarded the form, colour, and proportion of objects.&nbsp; 
Again and again I thought I saw before me trees and enclosures, 
but these, when I came up to them, invariably turned out to be 
only portions of gorse bushes projecting through the snow.&nbsp; 
My optical delusions as to <i>colour</i> were perhaps the most 
remarkable; the protruding rocks invariably appeared of a strange
orange yellow, with black lines along them, producing a short of 
tortoise-shell effect.&nbsp; I took these mysterious appearances 
<!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>at first for dead animals, ponies or sheep, and touched 
them to try to ascertain the fact.&nbsp; My hands, however, were 
so utterly devoid of sensation, that they were of no more use 
than my eyes in identifying objects.&nbsp; I was therefore quite 
in the dark as to their nature, till experience proved them to be
rocks with tufts of heather on them.&nbsp; Owing to my failing 
eyesight, my falls became very frequent, and several of them were
from heights so great that it would scarcely be believed were I 
to attempt to describe them.&nbsp; I may, however, say, that they
were such as perfectly to appal those who, a few days afterwards,
visited the spots where they occurred, and saw the deep 
impressions in the snow where I had plunged into it from the 
rocks above.&nbsp; One fall especially I well remember.&nbsp; I 
had just crossed the ridge of a hill, and saw, as I imagined, 
close below <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>me a pool covered with ice, which 
seemed free from snow.&nbsp; I thought I would walk across this, 
and, accordingly, made a slight jump from the rock on which I 
stood in order to reach it.&nbsp; In a moment, however, I 
discovered that, instead of on to a pool, I had jumped into empty
space.&nbsp; I must have fallen on this occasion a considerable 
distance, but I was caught in a deep snow-drift, so that, 
although considerably shaken and bewildered for the moment by 
what had happened, I was not seriously hurt.</p>
<p>I have been enabled by various circumstances, and by the help 
of those who followed my tracks before the snow melted, to make 
out with tolerable accuracy the course of my wanderings.&nbsp; 
Those who tracked me say that, &ldquo;If there was one part of 
the hill more difficult and dangerous than another, that is the 
line which Mr. Carr took.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>When the 
morning light first dawned, I could see that I was walking along 
the side of a ravine of great depth, and more than usually 
perpendicular sides; it was so steep that I could not climb to 
the top of the ridge and get out of it, and the snow was in such 
a very loose, soft state, that I expected every moment it would 
give way beneath me, and I should be precipitated into the depths
below.&nbsp; I had to walk with the greatest care to prevent 
this; and I believe that this was a very good thing for me, as it
gave my mind complete occupation, and kept me from 
flagging.&nbsp; I could only go straight on, as I could not 
ascend, and was afraid to descend.&nbsp; My method of progression
was more crawling than walking, as I had to drive my hands deep 
into the snow, and clutch at tufts of grass or heather, or any 
thing I could find beneath it, to hold on by.&nbsp; I must have 
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>gone forward in this way for an hour or two, when I 
found the ravine becoming less steep, and I heard the sound of 
running water very distinctly.&nbsp; Accordingly I thought I 
would descend and try once more whether I could walk down the 
stream, as this by its sound seemed a larger one, and I thought 
it might have cut a way through the drifts.&nbsp; I reached the 
bottom of the valley safely.&nbsp; It appears to have been the 
valley immediately above the Light Spout waterfall, and, trying 
to walk by the stream, I tumbled over the first upper fall.&nbsp;
Hearing a noise of falling water, and seeing dimly rocks all 
round me, I found it would not do to go forward in this 
direction, so, having unconsciously gone to the very edge of the 
lower cascade, where I must in all probability have been killed 
had I fallen over, I turned sharply up the hill again, going over
the rocks above, <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>and coming down again by a very steep
place.&nbsp; Round and round this waterfall I seemed to have 
climbed in every possible direction.&nbsp; A man who had tracked 
me, and with whom I visited the place a few weeks ago, said, 
&ldquo;You seem to have had a deal o&rsquo; work to do here, 
Sir,&rdquo; pointing to a small rocky space at the bottom of the 
fall.&nbsp; I had imagined, while thus going round and round as 
if on a tread mill, that I was walking straight forward down the 
stream, and I suppose my efforts to keep near the sound of the 
water misled me.&nbsp; Though perfectly familiar with this part 
of the Long Mynd, I was so blind at this time, and everything 
looked so strange, that I did not in the least recognise my 
position.&nbsp; Finding I did not get on very well, I determined 
now to try whether I could walk or crawl down the actual stream 
itself where it had hollowed its way underneath <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the drifts 
which overhung it, making a sort of low-arched tunnel, which I 
thought worth trying.&nbsp; I soon found, however, that this was 
quite impracticable, and that if I went on I should either be 
suffocated or hopelessly imbedded in the snow, and that then my 
utmost efforts would fail to extricate me.&nbsp; It also occurred
to me somewhat painfully, that if I lost my life, as I thought I 
inevitably must do now, my body would not be found for days, or 
it might be weeks, if it were buried deep in the mountain of snow
at the bottom of that valley; and I was anxious that what 
remained of me might be found soon, and that the dreadful 
suspense, which is worse than the most fearful certainty, might 
thus be spared to all those who cared about my fate.</p>
<p>I was not, however, quite beat yet; so, retracing my steps, I 
determined <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>once more to leave the stream and 
make for the higher ground.&nbsp; But a new misfortune now befell
me: I lost my boots.&nbsp; They were strong laced boots, without 
elastic sides, or any such weak points about them.&nbsp; I had 
observed before that one was getting loose, but was unable to do 
anything to it from the numbness of my hands; and after 
struggling out of a deep drift previous to reascending the hill, 
I found that I had left this boot behind.&nbsp; There was nothing
for it but to go on without, and as my feet were perfectly numbed
from the cold, and devoid of feeling, I did not experience any 
difficulty or pain on this account.&nbsp; That boot was 
afterwards found on a ledge of rock near the waterfall.&nbsp; I 
soon after lost the other one, or rather, I should say, it came 
off, and I could not get it on again, so I carried it in my hand 
some time, but lost it in one of my <!-- page 44--><a 
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>many severe 
falls.&nbsp; The fact of the loss of my boots has astonished all 
those who have heard of it, and I believe has excited more 
comment than any other part of my adventure.&nbsp; I have even 
heard of its being a matter of fierce dispute, on more than one 
occasion, whether laced boots <i>could</i> come off in this 
way.&nbsp; They do not seem to have become unlaced, as the laces 
were firmly knotted, but had burst in the middle, and the whole 
front of the boot had been stretched out of shape from the strain
put upon it whilst laboriously dragging my feet out of deep 
drifts for so many hours together, which I can only describe as 
acting upon the boots like a steam-power boot-jack.</p>
<p>And so for hours I walked on in my stockings without 
inconvenience.&nbsp; Even when I trod upon gorse bushes, I did 
not feel it, as my feet had become as <!-- page 45--><a 
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>insensible as
my hands.&nbsp; It had occurred to me now that I might be in the 
Carding Mill valley, and that I would steer my course on that 
supposition.&nbsp; It was fortunate that I did so, for I was 
beginning to think that I could not now hold out much longer, and
was struggling in a part where the drifts were up nearly to my 
neck, when I heard what I had thought never to hear 
again&mdash;the blessed sound of human voices, children&rsquo;s 
voices, talking and laughing, and apparently sliding not very far
off.&nbsp; I called to them with all my might, but judge of my 
dismay when sudden and total silence took the place of the merry 
voices I had so lately heard!&nbsp; I shouted again and again, 
and said that I was lost, but there was no reply.&nbsp; It was a 
bitter disappointment, something like that of the sailor 
shipwrecked on a desert island, who sees a sail approaching <!-- 
page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>and thinks that he is saved, when as he gazes the vessel
shifts her course and disappears on the horizon, dashing his 
hopes to the ground.&nbsp; It appeared, as I learned afterwards, 
that these children saw <i>me</i>, though I could not see them, 
and ran away terrified at my unearthly aspect.&nbsp; Doubtless 
the head of a man protruding from a deep snow drift, crowned and 
bearded with ice like a ghastly emblem of winter, was a sight to 
cause a panic among children, and one cannot wonder that they ran
off to communicate the news that &ldquo;there was the bogie in 
the snow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happily, however, for the bogie, he had 
noticed the direction from which these voices came, and 
struggling forward again, I soon found myself sufficiently near 
to the Carding Mill to recognise the place, blind as I was.&nbsp;
A little girl now ventured to approach me, as, true to the 
instincts of her <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>nature, the idea dawned upon her that
I was no goblin of the mountains, no disagreeable thing from a 
world beneath popped up through the snow, but a real 
fellow-creature in distress.&nbsp; I spoke to her and told her 
that I was the clergyman of Ratlinghope, and had been lost in the
snow on the hill all night.&nbsp; As she did not answer at once, 
I suppose she was taking a careful observation of me, for after a
few moments she said, &ldquo;Why, you look like Mr. Carr of 
Wolstaston.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am Mr. Carr,&rdquo; I replied; 
whereupon the boys, who had previously run away, and, as I 
imagine, taken refuge behind the girl, came forward and helped me
on to the little hamlet, only a few yards distant, where some 
half dozen cottages are clustered together round the Carding 
Mill.</p>
<p>I was saved, at any rate, from immediate peril, though I fully
expected <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>that serious illness must follow from
my violent exertions and long exposure.&nbsp; I was saved at all 
events from the death of lonely horror against which I had 
wrestled so many hours in mortal conflict, and scarcely knew how 
to believe that I was once more among my fellow-men, under a 
kindly, hospitable roof.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s hand had led me 
thither.&nbsp; No wisdom or power of my own could have availed 
for my deliverance, when once my sight was so much gone.&nbsp; 
The Good Shepherd had literally, in very deed, led the blind by a
way that he knew not to a refuge of safety and peace.</p>
<p>The good kind people at the Carding Mill, you may be sure, 
soon gathered round me in sympathising wonder, and I was quickly 
supplied with such comforts as they could give.&nbsp; I told them
that I had had scarcely anything to eat since breakfast the day 
before (as I <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>had been too much hurried to eat my 
luncheon before starting to Ratlinghope), and so tea and bread 
and butter were at once provided.&nbsp; The former was very 
grateful, but I could hardly eat the latter, as all feeling of 
hunger had left me.&nbsp; The good people were much shocked to 
find that I could not pick up a piece of bread and butter for 
myself, as I could neither feel it nor see it; I believe they 
thought my sight was hopelessly gone.&nbsp; I was, however, under
no uneasiness myself on this score, as I was perfectly familiar 
with snow blindness, having seen cases of it in Switzerland, and 
knew that in all probability my eyes would get quite right again 
in a week&rsquo;s time, as it turned out that they did.&nbsp; 
They also discovered that the middle finger of my right hand was 
terribly lacerated, and that the skin was completely stripped off
the back of it.&nbsp; This I knew to be a much more <!-- page 
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>serious affair, as the frost had evidently got fast hold
of it, and I thought it very likely that I should lose it.&nbsp; 
This, however, seemed a very trifling matter to me then.&nbsp; 
Had it been my right arm I should have thought nothing of it, 
after so marvellous an escape.&nbsp; I was provided at the 
Carding Mill with a hat, boots, and dry stockings; and having 
rested about a quarter of an hour, set out again to Church 
Stretton, about a mile distant.&nbsp; A man from the cottage came
with me, and gave me his arm, and with this assistance I 
accomplished the walk with comparative ease.&nbsp; I was so 
anxious to get home, that I almost felt as if I could have walked
the whole way, though I do not suppose that I could really have 
done so, my home being rather more than five miles off.&nbsp; 
Arrived at the town, I sent my companion for medical assistance, 
and myself made my way to <!-- page 51--><a 
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the Crown 
Inn.&nbsp; I could discern large objects sufficiently to find my 
way along the street, though all was blurred and indistinct, and 
the admission of light to my eyes was beginning to cause me 
extreme pain.&nbsp; I ordered a fly immediately to take me as far
as possible on my road home.&nbsp; No vehicle of any description 
had been along the turnpike road that day, and it was very 
doubtful how far a fly could go, so it was arranged that we 
should be accompanied by a man on a saddle horse, that I might 
ride when the fly could go no further, as I knew that, under the 
most favourable circumstances, the last mile and a half of the 
road to Wolstaston would be inaccessible to wheels.</p>
<p>Of course my adventure excited great interest at the Crown 
Hotel, when it was fully understood what had happened to 
me.&nbsp; It was just two o&rsquo;clock <!-- page 52--><a 
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>in the 
afternoon when I reached that place, and as I had left 
Ratlinghope at four o&rsquo;clock on the previous afternoon, I 
had been walking uninterruptedly for twenty-two hours, excepting 
the quarter of an hour I had rested at the Carding Mill.&nbsp; My
good friends at the hotel discovered that my clothes were very 
wet, for they had been frozen before and were now thawed, so I 
was dressed up in the landlord&rsquo;s garments.&nbsp; The effect
must have been very ludicrous, for he was a much stouter man than
I was at any time, and now I had shrunk away to nothing.&nbsp; It
will not therefore be wondered at that people when they saw me 
declared they should not have known who I was.</p>
<p>The surgeon having come and dressed my finger, and warned me 
to keep away from the fire and hot water, and having prescribed 
some hot brandy and water, I started in my fly on my homeward 
<!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
53</span>journey.&nbsp; Very slow was our progress.&nbsp; We had 
taken spades with us, and many times the driver and the man who 
accompanied him had to dig a way for the fly to get 
through.&nbsp; Most trying was the long delay thus caused to a 
man who knew that in his own home he must probably be reckoned 
among the dead; but there was no help for it, and at last 
Leebotwood was reached, the place where the lane to Wolstaston 
turned off from the main road, and where I was to leave the fly, 
and, as I hoped, ride home.</p>
<p>The Post Office is at Leebotwood, and having given orders 
there that any letters coming from my house should be stopped, I 
was helped on my horse, and, accompanied by the man, began to 
ascend the hill.&nbsp; I had not gone a hundred yards, when it 
became evident that it would be impossible to ride far, and that 
I should be obliged to walk <!-- page 54--><a 
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>again, so the
horse was sent back to Leebotwood by a man whom we met, and I 
started again on my own feet.&nbsp; Just at this time we met 
another man coming down over the fields from Wolstaston.&nbsp; He
had letters with him to post; those letters were from my 
home.&nbsp; They were to say that I had been lost in the snow 
storm, that every effort had been made to find me, that they had 
proved fruitless, and that there was no hope left.&nbsp; I sent 
this messenger back again pretty quickly, and told him to go home
as fast as he could and say I was coming.&nbsp; This news reached
the village about half an hour before I could get up there 
myself, and as may be supposed there was great rejoicing.&nbsp; 
So completely had all hope of my safety been given up, that to my
people it seemed almost like a resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>They had made the greatest efforts <!-- page 55--><a 
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>to find 
me.&nbsp; Twice a party had gone up the hill on the Sunday night 
to the limit of the enclosed ground, and stayed there calling and
shouting, till, as one of them said to me, they felt that if they
had stayed there another ten minutes, they would have been frozen
to death.&nbsp; The second time they went up that night, they 
actually got on to the open moorland some two or three hundred 
yards, but here they were in imminent danger of being lost 
themselves.&nbsp; One of them indeed declared that he could not 
return, and would have been lost had not his companions insisted 
on his struggling back with them.&nbsp; Human effort could do no 
more, and they made their toilsome way home prostrated with 
fatigue.</p>
<p>It was a fearful moment, they tell me, when the Rectory house 
was closed up for the night, the shutters fastened, and curtains 
drawn, with the fate of <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>its master unknown.&nbsp; The 
helpless watchers could only wait and count the weary hours, 
keeping food hot for the wanderer, who they feared would never 
return, and unable till the morning to plan any further efforts 
for his rescue.&nbsp; The awful wind raged on, sometimes assuming
to the ears of the excited listeners the sound of rolling wheels 
and horses&rsquo; feet, startling them into expectation, though 
they knew that the tramp of an army would have fallen noiseless 
on that depth of snow.&nbsp; Then again, it rose like shrieks and
wild calls of distress, and every now and then would smite the 
house with a buffet, as though it would level it with the 
ground.</p>
<p>The storm lulled at length, as the hours went slowly by.&nbsp;
Morning came and the men prepared to resume their almost hopeless
search once more.&nbsp; They started, about twenty strong, armed 
with spades and shovels, and <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>determined 
first of all to cut their way to Ratlinghope, thinking that 
perhaps I had remained there all night.&nbsp; They worked with 
all their might, but the snow was deeper than ever, and their 
progress was laborious and very slow.&nbsp; Though they had 
started as soon as it was light in the morning, they did not 
reach Ratlinghope till noon, and then their last hope was dashed 
to the ground, for they heard that I <i>had</i> started the 
previous afternoon, though pressed to remain in the village for 
the night.&nbsp; Great was the consternation of the Ratlinghope 
people when they heard the news.&nbsp; They knew the hill well, 
and said with one consent, &ldquo;If Mr. Carr was on the Long 
Mynd last night, he is a dead man.&rdquo;&nbsp; This conviction 
too was strengthened by the sad fact, that that very morning the 
dead body of a man, whom we all knew well, had been found in the 
road frozen to death, not more <!-- page 58--><a 
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>than one 
hundred and fifty yards from a small hamlet in the parish of 
Ratlinghope, known as &ldquo;The Bridges.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor 
Easthope, for such was his name, was a journeyman shoemaker by 
trade.&nbsp; He owned a few ponies which were on the hill, and he
had been looking after these on the Sunday.&nbsp; I suppose he 
was much exhausted by this, but he had safely reached his 
daughter&rsquo;s house in the evening, which he subsequently left
to go to the place where he worked, no great distance off.&nbsp; 
He was found, as I have said, the next morning frozen to death on
the turnpike road.&nbsp; It is conjectured that he either sat 
down to rest or fell down, and that he speedily became 
insensible.&nbsp; I think this fact in itself is sufficient to 
prove that, had I given way to the temptation to rest, I too 
should have lost my life.</p>
<p>The searching party, reinforced by <!-- page 59--><a 
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>most of the 
able-bodied men in Ratlinghope, beat that part of the hill lying 
between Ratlinghope and Wolstaston thoroughly, thinking that I 
must be somewhere in the tract between the two places, never 
supposing that I could have wandered as far away as I actually 
had done.&nbsp; The fog was so thick that it was only by keeping 
near to each other and shouting constantly that this party was 
able to keep together.&nbsp; I need not say that they failed to 
discover any trace of me, and about three o&rsquo;clock in the 
afternoon, worn out and exhausted, they returned to the Rectory 
with the worst tidings.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must be dead,&rdquo; they
said, &ldquo;he must <i>be</i> dead; it is not possible that any 
human creature could have lived through such a 
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was upon the receipt of these tidings 
that the letters were sent off which I so fortunately succeeded 
in stopping.&nbsp; Half-an-hour <!-- page 60--><a 
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>after, the 
news came that I was returning, and in another half-hour I was at
home.&nbsp; This was between four and five o&rsquo;clock in the 
afternoon, rather more than twenty-seven hours from the time I 
had left Wolstaston.</p>
<p>My friends tell me that had they not known who it was, they 
would scarcely have recognised me.&nbsp; Dressed in another 
man&rsquo;s clothes, exceedingly thin, with eyes fearfully 
bloodshot, and fingers stiff and shrunken, the middle finger more
resembling a dead stick, they say, with the gray and wrinkled 
bark on, than the living member of a human body, this is scarcely
to be wondered at.&nbsp; I was glad to go to bed at once, and to 
have my feet and hands well rubbed with snow.&nbsp; This, it 
should be well known, is the only thing to be done in cases of 
frost bite.&nbsp; Had I put them in hot water, I should in all 
probability have lost my fingers and toes; they <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>would have 
sloughed off.&nbsp; I know of several cases where this has 
happened; indeed, I heard of one quite lately, for the gardener 
of a friend of mine in Warwickshire had his hands frost-bitten 
while throwing the snow off the roof of a house during this last 
winter, and injudiciously putting them into hot water, the result
has been that he has lost the ends of all his fingers, to the 
first joint.&nbsp; In my case, I am thankful to say I knew better
than to do this, and by the use of cold water and continued 
friction have succeeded in restoring my hands in a great 
measure.&nbsp; They have still not nearly as much sensation in 
them as before, but this will return with time.&nbsp; During the 
last few weeks, gorse pricks have been working out of my hands 
and feet and legs by hundreds, though at first, from the numbness
of the skin, I was quite unconscious of them.&nbsp; It is not to 
be wondered at that I should <!-- page 62--><a

these up in great numbers whilst walking through the gorse bushes
without my boots, and clutching at them as I fell in hopes of 
saving myself.</p>
<p>Such are the details of my &ldquo;Night in the Snow,&rdquo; 
and my most wonderful preservation through it and the following 
day.&nbsp; I trust that no one who may chance to read these pages
will ever be placed in a similar position; but should it so 
happen, I hope that the remembrance of my adventure will occur to
them; for surely it teaches, as plainly as anything can, that 
even in the most adverse circumstances no one need ever despair; 
and shows how an individual of no unusual physical powers may, by
God&rsquo;s help, resist the overwhelming temptation to sleep 
which is usually so fatal to those who are lost in the snow.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
